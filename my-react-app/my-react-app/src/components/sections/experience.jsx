                            Under the guidance of Dr. Tweety Twang our team worked on characterising two unknown breast cancer cell lines then quantifying which one was the most resitant to "unfavourable growth conditions".

                        <li>
                            By subjecting the breast cancer cell lines to mechanical stress and nutrient starvation, we created unfavourable growth conditions and measured the proliferation rates of the two cells.

                        <li>
                            By creating a systematic way to measure breast cancer cell resilience, with an empthasis on mechanical stress and nutrient starvation, we believe that we can have an impact on improving drug screening and personalised treatment strategies.

                             During our research, my colleague and I realised that cell subculture was made more complicated than it needed to be. We identified that the process itself could be simplified.

                        <li>
                            Me and Dameer spent some time creating an educational video outlining the key aspects of cell subculture in the hopes to simplify the daunting process and make it more accessible to aspiring researchers and scientists.

                            But we were not satisfied with the video alone. This video would become the foundation for a later device that me and him would design â€“ {" "}
